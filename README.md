# GroqChat
This project demonstrates a simple question-answering application built using LangChain, the Groq language model API, and Streamlit.  It allows users to input a question, which is then passed to the Groq LLM (specifically the llama3-8b-8192 model) via a LangChain chain. The LLM's response is then displayed in the Streamlit application.
